When a White police officer responded to the call, the results left many social media users in awe.</p><p class=dh>A recent post on the City of Hapeville Police's social media showed a short Facebook clip of a young Black boy hugging a police officer after being shown something in his car's boot. The little boy had to deal with the Georgia police because someone had called the cops on him.</p><p class=dh>According to a recount of the boy's story, police were called to a neighborhood to remove the boy from there. It wasn't clear whether the community knew who the boy was or why he was there before calling the police on him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/df98a3810b828eecc39b50b36e0c37977c9054829ae5e37d48a2abfbcb407472.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Officer Colleran gets a hug from a boy after taking him to his car's boot to show him something after neighborhood people called the police on the child on July 24, 2023 | Source: Facebook/City of Hapeville Police</p><p class=dh>However, unlike most stories where police are called on Black people, this story had a good ending.
