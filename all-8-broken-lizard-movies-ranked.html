The five-person company consists of Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske, all bringing their unique brand of humor. The group’s five members first met at Colgate University, where they began developing their comedic skills. They founded the Broken Lizard comedy troupe after graduating and relocating to New York City.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=744 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>Their first picture,&nbsp;Puddle Cruiser, emerged in 1996 and established the style they would use throughout their career: a blend of quirky humor, sharp banter, and an appreciation for the absurd. The group’s breakout picture was the comedy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Troopers</a>, about a bunch of prankster state troopers. The entire cast contributed to the script, which Chandrasekhar directed. The film became a surprise success thanks to its memorable lines, off-the-wall humor, and endearing (though dysfunctional) characters. They came out with the horror comedy&nbsp;Club Dread, which made fun of slasher movies in 2004. Mixed reviews aside, it further established the group’s reputation for crossing over artistic boundaries and taking creative risks.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>While Broken Lizard hasn’t always been well-received by reviewers, they’ve maintained a dedicated following due to their quirky sense of humor, willingness to experiment, and genuine friendship on and off the screen. Overall, Broken Lizard’s works have provided audiences with a distinct humorous voice that continues to resonate and entertain, distinguishing them as an outstanding comedy group in American cinema. Here’s a list of their top eight films.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-8-the-slammin-salmon-2009 data-injectable=false>8.&nbsp;The Slammin’ Salmon (2009)</h2><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>The Slammin’ Salmon — directed by Kevin Heffernan of the Broken Lizard comedy troupe — premiered in 2009 with all the members of Broken Lizard working together on the script, as they do with all of their movies. The plot follows Cleon “Slammin'” Salmon (the late Michael Clarke Duncan), a former heavyweight boxing champion, who owns a restaurant in Miami, and the story centers on a single, hectic night of service.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The wait staff makes a mad dash to sell, upsell, and encourage the eccentric customers to win the cash prize and avoid a pummeling from the ex-boxing champ Salmon when he initiates a contest to see who can earn the most money in one night. Despite not having the cult following of&nbsp;Super Troopers,&nbsp;The Slammin’ Salmon&nbsp;is nonetheless widely beloved by viewers for its offbeat sense of comedy, strong acting, and original take on the restaurant industry.</p><h2 id=h-7-puddle-cruiser-1996 data-injectable=false>7.&nbsp;Puddle Cruiser&nbsp;(1996)</h2><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Broken Lizard debuted with&nbsp;Puddle Cruiser,&nbsp;a low-budget comedy-drama that follows the lives of five friends from college, mirroring the real-life history of the group’s members as they met at Colgate. The film, which Jay Chandrasekhar directed and the entire cast and crew wrote, is an example of the group’s early comic style. It sets the stage for many themes central to their later work, such as friendship, absurdity, and satire. The plot centers on Felix (Steve Lemme), a college student who develops feelings for Suzanne (Kayren Butler).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>When he finds out, however, that Suzanne is dating one of his teammates on the rugby team, he is faced with a moral problem. The film&nbsp;Puddle Cruiser&nbsp;was partially shot at Colgate University, which helped create a genuine collegiate feel.&nbsp;Puddle Cruiser&nbsp;premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival. However, the film did not gain widespread release and remained relatively forgotten until the group rose to prominence with&nbsp;Super Troopers.</p><h2 id=h-6-the-babymakers-2012 data-injectable=false>6.&nbsp;The Babymakers&nbsp;(2012)</h2><p data-characters=785 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>Jay Chandrasekhar, along with the other members of Broken Lizard, directs and appears in the comedy film&nbsp;The Babymakers&nbsp;as a supporting character. Though it has the Broken Lizard comedy style, the film is not truly a Broken Lizard production since not all of the group’s members play significant roles, and the troupe did not create the script.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tommy (Paul Schneider) and Audrey (Olivia Munn)</a>&nbsp;are the protagonists, and their struggle to have a child is the story’s central conflict. After several futile attempts, Tommy discovers that his sperm count is too low to conceive naturally. Following this discovery, he devises a plan to steal a deposit he made years ago at a sperm bank, resulting in a series of amusing and even more desperate pranks.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>In contrast to Broken Lizard’s typical comedies, which feature a large cast, this one centers on the main characters and their struggles with infertility. Still,&nbsp;The Babymakers&nbsp;features the usual blend of crass humor and touching moments that have become the group’s trademark. The humorous style of earlier Broken Lizard movies is present here, thanks to director Jay Chandrasekhar. Kevin Heffernan makes a cameo appearance as Tommy’s friend who helps him with his botched robbery of a sperm bank. The ridiculousness of the scenario and Tommy’s determination to find a solution provide comic relief.</p><h2 id=h-5-club-dread-2004 data-injectable=false>5.&nbsp;Club Dread&nbsp;(2004)&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>The events of&nbsp;Club Dread&nbsp;take place in a resort owned by Bill Paxton’s washed-up pop star character, Coconut Pete. Murders of a strange nature take place on the island, which is famous for its wild parties. Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske, all of the Broken Lizard ensemble, play resort employees who, among the mounting commotion, must determine who committed the murder.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>With its isolated setting, mystery attacker, and collection of unwitting victims,&nbsp;Club Dread&nbsp;is an obvious satire of the slasher genre. Broken Lizard’s signature brand of comedy takes these cliches and makes them laughably ludicrous. The picture deftly juggles horror with humor, keeping the audience laughing and on edge throughout. Some critics praised&nbsp;Club Dread&nbsp;for successfully blending horror and comedy, while others found the combination jarring. Regardless, the film has since developed a cult following among those who admire its originality of style, wit, and comedy and its brilliant spoof of established genres.</p><h2 id=h-4-quasi-2023 data-injectable=false>4.&nbsp;Quasi&nbsp;(2023)</h2><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Directed by Kevin Heffernan and written by Heffernan and other members of the Broken Lizard crew — including Steve Lemme, Jay Chandrasekhar, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske —&nbsp;Quasi&nbsp;is a Hulu original film and a satirical version of Victor Hugo’s 1831 classic&nbsp;The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story takes place in medieval France, where Steve Lemme’s character – the hunchback Quasi, and Kevin Heffernan’s character – Duchamp, both serve as torturers. A series of events involving a papal drawing and a conflict between King Guy (Jay Chandrasekhar) and Pope Cornelius (Paul Soter) result in Quasi’s sudden popularity and a subsequent assassination plot.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>Adrianne Palicki’s Queen Catherine becomes romantically involved with Quasi, and they work together to foil the assassination plot. Among the many unexpected turns in the story are discoveries of royal blood, the formation of an unlikely alliance, and public execution. Each member of Broken Lizard plays more than one role. Paul Soter portrays Pope Cornelius and Lucien, Steve Lemme plays Quasi Modo and Jester, while Erik Stolhanske appears as Cardinal Claude and Michel Demek. Jay Chandrasekhar plays King Guy and Blouin. Adrianne Palicki, who plays Queen Catherine, and Eugene Cordero, who plays Pascal, round out the cast.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-3-beerfest-2006 data-injectable=false>3.&nbsp;Beerfest&nbsp;(2006)</h2><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Beerfest&nbsp;features Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd (Erik Stolhanske) Wolfhouse, two brothers who go to Germany to scatter their grandfather’s ashes at Oktoberfest. Along the way, they discover a hidden, centuries-old competition known as “Beerfest,” where they quickly get embarrassed by their lack of preparation and talent. Upon their return to the United States, they form a drinking team comprised of pals with various drinking skills in preparation for Beerfest the following year. Landfill (Kevin Heffernan), Barry (Jay Chandrasekhar), and Fink (Steve Lemme) are the team members.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>The members of Broken Lizard have emphasized that the film is a funny satire of sports movies and does not advocate binge drinking despite its heavy emphasis on beer and drinking games. Since its release, the picture has acquired a devoted fanbase and been synonymous with Broken Lizard’s other hits like Super&nbsp;Troopers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Club Dread. The cast also includes noteworthy performers – including Donald Sutherland, Will Forte, and Jürgen Prochnow, known for his role as a submarine captain in&nbsp;Das Boot,&nbsp;a part he parodies in&nbsp;Beerfest.</p><h2 id=h-2-super-troopers-2-2018 data-injectable=false>2.&nbsp;Super Troopers 2&nbsp;(2018)</h2><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Written and starring members of the Broken Lizard comedy troupe, Jay Chandrasekhar’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Troopers 2</a>&nbsp;is a sequel to the film of the same name from 2001. The events of&nbsp;Super Troopers 2&nbsp;occur years after the original film’s events. After a tragic incident involving actor Fred Savage, the police officers involved have been terminated from their positions with the Spurbury Police Department. Captain O’Hagen, the group’s former leader, organizes a fishing vacation for all of them in Canada.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Upon arrival, the group learns that O’Hagen had arranged to meet with Vermont Governor Jessman, who shares the news that a new land survey has indicated that the area in Canada was initially intended for the United States. She’ll give them all full-time jobs if they agree to re-enlist as state troopers. During their stint as state troopers in Canada, they come upon a drug operation, are pranked by Canadian Mounties, and face opposition from locals who wish to keep living in Canada.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-super-troopers-2001 data-injectable=false>1.&nbsp;Super Troopers&nbsp;(2001)</h2><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>Super Troopers&nbsp;is a cult classic that takes place in the made-up town of Spurbury, Vermont, right on the border with Canada. It chronicles five state troopers’ absurd and often hilarious activities as their station faces closure due to budget shortages. Members of Broken Lizard assume the roles of the troopers, who are notorious for pulling elaborate pranks on each other and the innocent drivers they stop.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=false>De facto leader Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar) enjoys syrup and pretends to be high on various drugs; the dim-witted but good-natured Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske); the hard-nosed Farva (Kevin Heffernan) – who is always trying to fit in with the rest of the team; Mac (Steve Lemme) – the wildcard who is always ready to “jump into action,” and Foster (Paul Soter) – the rookie engaged in a romantic triangle with two police officers. The troopers are up to their usual antics when they happen onto a drug smuggling organization. They jump at the chance to solve the case, possibly saving their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXW16o77OpJynZZyex6K%2Bw2akqK6ZmsBuvsCnop6cXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-8-broken-lizard-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brooke-liddell-wikipedia-age-biography-height-parents-family-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brooke-liddell-wikipedia-age-biography-height-parents-family-instagram.html>Brooke Liddell Wikipedia, Age, Biography , Height, Parents, Family, Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./9-facts-about-snowglobe-music-festival.html>9 Facts About SnowGlobe Music Festival</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./9-facts-about-snowglobe-music-festival.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
