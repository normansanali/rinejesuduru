<time>09 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Amanda Batula</strong> addressed where she stands with fellow Summer House actress Lindsay Hubbard after her appearance on Watch What Happens Live (WWHL) with Andy Cohen drew harsh comments from the latter. The couple made news when Amanda claimed Lindsay was disrespectful to their followers when she was “taken off guard.” The term “responsibility” refers to the act of determining whether or not a person is responsible for his or her own actions.</p><p>Amanda spoke out about her current connection with her Summer House co-star in an interview with US Weekly, saying:</p><p>“We’re not going to stand. We haven’t said anything.”</p><p>Lindsay recently appeared on Season 2 of Winter House with her boyfriend Carl Radke, where she once again became a prominent storyline after Austen claimed to cast members that she had made improper gestures towards him on the night of Kyle and Amanda’s wedding. Carl also decided to give their relationship another go at that time.</p><h2>Amanda Batula discusses her friendship with Lindsay Hubbard.</h2><p>Amanda broke her silence over her WWHL statements with Andy Cohen in an interview with US Weekly. She remarked that it was the show’s premise and the structure that required her to be amusing that led to her statements, but she didn’t think it could impact Lindsay this deeply. Amanda stated:</p><p>“Listen, you sit in that seat on Watch What Happens Life and you play these games and you want to be entertaining and fun and goofy and spill the tea, and you don’t always think. It’s difficult to think on your toes when everything you say has the potential to affect others.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Amanda-Batula-1.jpg alt="Amanda Batula" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She also added that it was not her purpose to upset and harm Lindsay and if she had known about it, then she wouldn’t have done it or gotten along with Andy on the topic. The Winter House actor expressed regret for the event. Amanda, however, also alleged that presenter Andy Cohen pressed for an answer from her.</p><p>“I was just trying to, I don’t know, like, spill the tea or be shady or whatever it is — but I didn’t even say anything. I didn’t say anything. I was about to say, ‘No one here,’ as I glanced at that screen. I was done after that. He continued going, and [Andy] kept pushing, and I thought to myself, ‘OK, OK, maybe.'”</p><p>Lindsay, for her part, had addressed the problem on social media following Amanda’s visit. Summer House actress justified her viewpoint, saying she was always supportive of her co-stars and never unpleasant to her fans. In her November 2022 visit to Katie Maloney’s You’re Gonna Love Me podcast, the publicist expressed her fears and stated:</p><p>“I’m on the go. Like, I have a lot of engagements on the streets of New York because that is what we do. I believe I am more out there than others. I attend concerts and athletic activities. I’m simply hanging around. Amanda walks out of my home once for every 100 times I leave.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Amanda-Batula-2.jpg alt="Amanda Batula" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The term “responsibility” refers to the act of determining whether or not a person is responsible for the actions of another person. She stated:</p><p>“She was fantastic from my experience at BravoCon and she’s been lovely to fans at all the Loverboy events. That was never my intention. And she’s correct. We would never, ever, ever allow her to attend a Loverboy event if she was disrespectful to them, which she is not.”</p><p>Lindsay’s feud with former best friend Danielle Olivera will be documented in the forthcoming season of Summer House, as well Lindsay’s feud with Amanda. Amanda added in the interview that fans would have to wait and watch the season to figure out what happened since there were chats between the two pals that other cast members were unaware of.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYppmema5ursCtrKWZXZm2tK%2FUrKqeq12dsrN50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16rbXNnaqasV2dwqOuwKubZp6fobmww8innmaglad6uMPHpWSdnZKqwXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famanda-batula-discusses-her-relationship-with-lindsay-hubbard-following-her-wwhl-debut.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./asa-butterfield.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./asa-butterfield.html>Asa Butterfield</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-jake-pauls-net-worth-in-2024.html>What is Jake Paul's Net Worth in 2024?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-jake-pauls-net-worth-in-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
