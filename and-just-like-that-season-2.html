After the show's HBO Max reboot, And Just Like That, wrapped up its inaugural season, there was no guarantee that Carrie and Co. — minus one Samantha Jones — would be back for a sophomore season. However, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> confirmed that the series will be returning for another round, meaning that viewers should be getting another dose of Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis along with newcomers Sara Ramirez, Nicole Ari Parker, Sarita Choudhury, and Karen Pittman.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am delighted and excited to tell more stories about these vibrant, bold characters — played by these powerful, amazing actors. The fact is, we're all thrilled. And Just like That … our Sex life is back," showrunner Michael Patrick King said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have been delighted by the cultural conversation generated by these characters and their stories, set in a world we already know and love so much," Sarah Aubrey, the head of original content at HBO Max, added. "We are proud of the work Michael Patrick King and our wonderful writers, producers, cast and crew have done to bring these stories to the screen. We can't wait for fans to see what's in store for Season 2!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though few about the show's second season have been released, it wouldn't be out of line to expect the return of most of the cast, though it would probably be safe to assume that Kim Cattrall will not be making a return — however open the invitation may be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We did something that was hard to do, which is we took something familiar and did make it new — for better and for worse," King said when the first season of the show wrapped on February 1.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> in June 2021, King added that Samantha Jones will be back in season 2 — although she'll remain in Carrie's phone. He even promised that there'd be more of Samantha and Carrie's exchanges, even though he's not quite sure where that story will go in the future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's very funny, because every single one of the writers has a different version of what happened during that conversation," King said of Carrie and Samantha's meeting in the season 1 finale, though he had some ideas of his own. "So, I think there was some Champagne. I think there was a grown-up back and forth, and a love affair that they realized that something's more important than being afraid to heal. I'm sure they had a great night. To me, they had a great night and things became resolved. Once Carrie let go of an old, old love, one of her current loves came back in."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are There Any Returning Cast Members?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie Bradshaw's former love interest Aiden Shaw (play by John Corbett) is expected to return and is "set for a substantial, multi-episode arc on the second season of the&nbsp;Sex and the City&nbsp;follow-up," according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deadline</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The outlet also recently reported that the iconic Tony Danza will be joining the reboot to play Che's father figure on their sitcom. Miranda's new romantic interest even hinted at the casting of Danza when they said the actor was "coming in to read for my father."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Candice Bergen, who famously played Enid Frick, Carrie's&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;editor, is officially reprising her role, showrunner&nbsp;Michael Patrick King&nbsp;exclusively told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Candice Bergen is back as Enid, which we're thrilled about because I always loved Enid," King said in an interview for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>EW's 2023 Summer Preview</a>. "She is a cold, wonderful diva of publishing."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Will There Be Any Surprise Guest Stars?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to EW, Feminist icon&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Gloria Steinem</a>&nbsp;will appear on the show playing herself. Singer Sam Smith will also appear as himself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Two days after they won the Grammy, they're on our show with a Carrie necklace that says 'Sam.' They said they and their sisters all have them," King explained. "That is the gold of having done a show that people liked: you call Sam Smith to play this nice part that we needed, and they're like, 'Yes, cause I love the show.' That's really thrilling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Then there's some treats, which I'm not gonna tell you," King added. "There's a couple of surprises every now and then."<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When Did Production on Season 2 Start?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On October 5, 2022, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis were spotted on the set of And Just Like That... season 2 in New York City. In the images captured, Parker who plays the beloved Carrie Bradshaw wore a gray long-sleeve utility jumpsuit that she paired with heels and a JW Anderson pigeon purse — which gives us flashbacks to the columnist's famous diamond swan purse from the original show. Davis, who plays Charlotte, wore a black pencil skirt and sheer button-down blouse with a pinky bow and pointy-toe pumps. The two girls appeared to smile as the walked beneath umbrellas on a rainy day in Manhattan.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What Day Will Season 2 Premiere?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">HBO announced that And Just Like That ... season 2 will premiere with two episodes on Thursday, June 22. After that, a new episode will arrive on the streamer (which will be rebranded as Max by then) each week.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is there a trailer for And Just Like That ...

The video shows Charlotte balancing motherhood with her career, gives an update on Miranda and Ché, and definitely answers a big question.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For fans wondering exactly how Aidan and Carrie return to each other's orbits, it's (believe it or not) via email. "Hey Stranger… Remember me? IF this is still your email, it’s me – Carrie. Was just thinking about you the other day… and I wondered how you were doing. So, how ya doing?” Carrie writes. And just like that, the clip jumps to them sitting down together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Sitting here with you, it’s like 10 years just — (snaps),” Aidan tells Carrie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570Z6top2nqHqku9WeqZqflWSur7CMo6ysrF2htqyxjK2fmqxdqLKiv86nZGs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fand-just-like-that-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./latoya-tonodeo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./latoya-tonodeo.html>Ghost cast LaToya Tonodeo dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emily-morgan-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89790-html.html>Emily Morgan Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emily-morgan-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89790-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
