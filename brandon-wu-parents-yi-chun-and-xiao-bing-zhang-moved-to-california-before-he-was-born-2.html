They played golf as a hobby when he was just a child.</p><p>The 25-year-old athlete had decided to play golf at an early age.&nbsp;Brad, whose Chinese name is Bi Yuan, picked up the golf club when he was just six. He was in California when he played the beautiful game for the first time.</p><p>The American Chinese credited for his success goes towards his parents, who taught him how to hit the ball with a club.</p><p>His folks developed competitive yet humble characteristics in him. He remembers going 56 in his first nine-hole competition when he was eight. “I thought I performed alright, but dad said I could have done better, and he was right,” the student said.</p><p>After that, he decided to strive to shoot higher scores. In an interview, he said he is grateful that his parents encouraged him to play golf.</p><p>Whether it was the chance to attend Stanford or the potential of becoming a professional golfer, they saw the bigger picture of what golf can provide. As a result, they paved the way for the prospect of golf.</p><p>Wu also said that he participated in various activities, including swimming, baseball, tennis, and more like other kids. However, he played a lot of golf when he was younger just because it was enjoyable for his dad to take him to the course, where he could ride the golf cart and whack balls. It was undoubtedly an excellent father-son connection, he said.</p><p>The player’s father took him to attend the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, Asia’s only World Golf Championships tournament, during his time in the Chinese capital city, which is when Wu became hooked on golf.</p><p>He took part in the pro-am one year after winning a junior competition that was a part of the Middle Kingdom’s HSBC Junior Golf Program.</p><h2 id=golfer-brandon-wu-family-relocated-to-california><span class=ez-toc-section id=golfer-brandon-wu-family-relocated-to-california></span> Golfer Brandon Wu Family Relocated To California<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brandon Wu’s parents, from China, relocated to California for better opportunities.
