Spray a complete wet coat over the surface. Use a soft cloth to wipe away any excess discoloration by wiping in a circular motion with the cloth. Allow some of the solvent to flash off for a deeper colour – up to 15 minutes maximum working time – to get a richer hue.
How would you go about applying wipe stains in this manner?
