He also serves as a co-anchor of the network's show 20/20.</p><p>Muir had a similar start to journalism as Sawyer, having gotten his start at a small news station as well. He later went on to join ABC News and worked his way up to the ABC World News sound stage.</p><p>Although <a href=#>David Muir works hard to keep certain aspects of his personal life under wraps</a>, it's not as easy to keep your earnings a secret when you are in the entertainment industry. While ABC has not formally released his salary, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine speculates that the anchor earns between 5 and 7 million</a> per year for his journalism work on both ABC World News and 20/20. The publication estimates his net worth to be around 20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When comparing Sawyer and Muir's net worth, it's obvious that Diane's sits much higher than David's. However, it's imperative to look at the span of their careers. David Muir was born in 1973, which is when Diane Sawyer was serving in the press office at the White House.</p><p>Therefore, she has several more years under her belt in the journalism realm. It's likely that as time progresses, David Muir will find himself at a similar net worth level as his predecessor, the esteemed Diane Sawyer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopmemnq0rdaynKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZaaav7TB0mabmq6ZmXquwcirZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-net-worth-versus-david-muir.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./greek-salad-dressing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./greek-salad-dressing.html>Greek Salad Dressing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dexter-fowler.html>Dexter Fowler</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dexter-fowler.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
