<time>23 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A week before <strong><a href=#>Selling Sunset</a></strong> season 6 aired on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>, Chrishell Stause announced that she had just tied the knot with Australian singer, G Flip. In 2022, an anonymous source revealed that the two got <a href=#>engaged shortly after going Instagram official</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple had an Elvis impersonator officiate their Las Vegas wedding, √† la <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong> and Travis Barker. The two had been dating for a year, with the realtor coming from a <a href=#>highly publicized split with Jason Oppenheim</a>.</p><p>"Our first year is gonna be hard to beat, but here's to trying! I love you babyyyyy ü•∞ Happy anniversary @gflip," Stause wrote on Instagram on March 15, 2023. Meanwhile, G wrote on her account, "365 days adoring you ‚ù§Ô∏è @chrishellstause."</p><p>Now that G has made her first appearance on the show, fans can't help but wonder if their co-stars were informed about their wedding. It doesn't seem like they knew about their plans. Could it be due to Stause's falling out with Mary Fitzgerald who admitted to not knowing about it?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Heather El Moussa Get Banned By Selling Sunset?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-chrishell-stause-39-s-39-untraditional-39-wedding-to-g-flip>Inside Chrishell Stause's 'Untraditional' Wedding To G Flip</h2><p>Alongside an Instagram Reel showing moments from their Vegas wedding, Stause wrote: "Love doesn't always go as planned‚Ä¶ Sometimes it's immeasurably better." True enough, that's exactly how their wedding went. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Access Hollywood</a> recently, she said: "It was not what people would expect ‚Äî we did everything untraditional."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chrishell--G-Flip.jpg><p>"The planning ... and everything down to having the paper and all of these things that are really stressful and [involve] planning, I've done that before," she added. "None of that means anything unless your connection is what means something, so we honestly did everything the opposite."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality star even confessed that she and G "forgot" to get engaged before their wedding, shattering the rumors that they got engaged last year. "It happened on takeoff on the way to Vegas," she said. She also told People that they only had a "very small group there with us and some friends and family watching on a live stream."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Emma Hernan Actually Like Her Selling Sunset Co-Stars And Can They Stand Her?</a></span></p><h2 id=did-chrishell-stause-tell-the-selling-sunset-cast-about-her-wedding>Did Chrishell Stause Tell The Selling Sunset Cast About Her Wedding?</h2><p>The spontaneous wedding might have been the reason Stause didn't inform the Selling Sunset cast about her wedding. Fitzgerald later told E! News: "I texted her and was like, 'Is this a game or something where you're messing with people?' And she's like, 'No, actually we really did it.' So, I'm getting ready to throw a party."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The latter's comments seemingly show that the two are on good terms despite being distant from each other in the latest season. However, <a href=#>Emma Hernan ‚Äî who's now Stause's closest friend</a> in the group "knew when it happened," she said. "I was going to be there! But I couldn't make it happen."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B541B7F5-F1C0-43B6-B2A8-A054BC4DF70B.png><p>"I was so excited. Honestly, I've never seen a relationship like that. There is something so special about it, because they support each other like I've never seen in any other relationship," she continued. "When I say it's relationship goals, I have goosebumps talking about it now because seeing them together is so magical... Seeing [Chrishell] happy is the best thing in the entire world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite skipping her friend's wedding, Hernan said that she was the one tasked to plan their wedding party. "Yes! I am the planner. I love planning and we already talked about it last night." The Days of Our Lives alum's ex-boyfriend, Oppenheim was also kept in the loop. He said he'd "congratulated both her and G. I knew, but it was nice to see them publicly announce it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jason Oppenheim Had Some Brutally Honest Thoughts About Christine Quinn‚Äôs Selling Sunset Exit</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-chrishell-stause-amp-mary-fitzgerald>What Happened Between Chrishell Stause & Mary Fitzgerald?</h2><p>In season 6, Stause and co-star Nicole Young got into a feud with the former alleging the latter of using drugs. The accused realtor threatened to sue for defamation after taking a full drug test the morning after the heated argument. As it all escalated, Fitzgerald was forced to mediate and call them both out for their mistakes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Fitzgerald told Young that it was wrong for her to claim that Stause only got a listing because Oppenheim had a crush on her at that time, she also slammed the latter for making such serious drug accusations. During the premiere, Stause had already spilled that she and Fitzgerald were "distant" from each other following her breakup with Oppenheim, whom Fitzgerald used to date as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrishell-Stause-Mary-Fitzgerald.jpg><p>"My relationship with Mary feels a little distant, because Jason and I broke up and Mary wasn't there," the former soap opera star said at that time. "And I feel like she chose Jason's side and kind of gave our friendship up a little."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But according to Fitzgerald, she said it was only because Oppenheim was "beside himself" while Stause was "off doing her own thing." In another episode, Stause said that Fitzgerald hadn't made an effort to know her partner.</p><p>"I love Mary so much, but I feel like our relationship is not the same as it has been since the breakup. I get it, she's been friends with Jason forever and this always happens with breakups or divorces," she said. "It really does mean a lot to me that so many of the girls have taken time to get to know G. And I just wish that, you know, Mary would show some effort."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLWztdKhnKWkXajBosHSnmSknZWleqmx0WaunpyUnruoecBmqp6boprBbrLRqKRmpZGnxm6yyK2xoJ2ilrmlew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-chrishell-stause-keep-her-wedding-a-secret-from-mary-fitzgerald.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gray-wolf-pups-colorado.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gray-wolf-pups-colorado.html>Gray Wolf Pups Seen In Colorado For The First Time In 80 Years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./crazy-ex-girlfriend.html>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./crazy-ex-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
