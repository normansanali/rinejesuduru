However, there's a stigma in Hollywood that dramatic <strong>actors</strong> can't be funny, and <a href=#>comedians can't be serious</a>. There are a select few, however, that have proven everybody wrong. Here are ten dramatic <strong>actors</strong> who went on to star in <a href=#><strong>sitcoms</strong></a>:</p><h2 id=rob-lowe><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rob Lowe</span></h2><p>Rob Lowe has been acting since the '80s. A young heartthrob, Lowe had roles in iconic films, including St. Elmo's Fire.&nbsp;The actor later starred in NBC political drama The West Wing, but he&nbsp;switched gears from drama to comedy when he was cast as&nbsp;the perpetually&nbsp;positive fitness freak Chris Traeger in NBC's mockumentary <a href=#>Parks and Recreation</a>.&nbsp;Lowe has had roles on a variety of television shows and movies since his time on Parks and Rec, and can currently be found on the series&nbsp;9-1-1: Lone Star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andre-braugher><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Andre Braugher</span></h2><p>Actor Andre Braugher has also been acting for decades. Braugher starred as Frank Pembletom in Homicide: Life on the Street back in the 90s, and had roles in other television shows and movies before starring as Captain Raymond Holt in another cop show, sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The show started on Fox and was picked up by NBC after being cancelled by Fox. NBC has announced <a href=#>the show will end</a> after its upcoming eighth season.</p><h2 id=john-goodman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>John Goodman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the start of his career, John Goodman had roles in lots of movies, spanning many genres, including crime, mystery, drama, and romance. In the early '90s, he landed a starring role in hit sitcom Roseanne as the titular character's husband Dan Conner. Goodman has had lots of other roles since, including Sully in Pixar cartoons&nbsp;Monsters, Inc.&nbsp;and prequel&nbsp;Monsters University. Goodman later&nbsp;reprised his role of Dan Conner for the Roseanne reboot, and again for the spin-off&nbsp;The Conners.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where's Roseanne Ever Since She Got Fired?</a></span></p><h2 id=paul-sun-hyung-lee><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Paul Sun-Hyung Lee</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Korean Canadian actor and television host Paul Sun-Hyung Lee has been in the entertainment industry for decades now.

Lee has had roles in films, as well as other stage productions.</p><h2 id=james-avery><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Avery</span></h2><p>James Avery had an illustrious decades-long acting career with roles in movies and television. Avery voiced Shredder in the animated series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and then started his sitcom career as Philip Banks, successful lawyer and no-nonsense uncle of Will in hit television series The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.&nbsp;He had roles in several movies and television shows after the sitcom ended until his untimely death in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janet-hubert><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Janet Hubert</span></h2><p>Janet Hubert's career began like most actors' careers with small parts in movies and television shows. Hubert had&nbsp;a part in the movie&nbsp;21 Jump Street&nbsp;before being cast as Vivian Banks, wife of Philip and aunt of Will alongside James Avery in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.&nbsp;Her tenure on the show did not last the entire series, however, reportedly due to an ongoing feud with co-star Will Smith. Hubert went on to play roles in several other television shows after her time on the sitcom.</p><h2 id=anna-chlumsky><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Anna Chlumsky</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna Chlumsky has been on television for over a decade now, playing parts on shows like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, White Collar, and Army Wives before starting her role as Amy Brookheimer alongside sitcom veterans Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tony Hale in Veep, the award-winning HBO sitcom about the first woman to be elected Vice President.

He eventually was cast as&nbsp;Chidi Anagonye, the indecisive professor on NBC's fantasy comedy series The Good Place, created by Michael Schur, co-creator of The Office&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parks and Recreation. The Good Place ended after four seasons, and since then&nbsp;Anagonye has rhad roles in other television shows like Love Life and The Underground Railroad.</p><h2 id=leighton-meester><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Leighton Meester</span></h2><p>Best known for her role as Blair Waldorf in hit CW series Gossip Girl, <a href=#>Leighton Meester</a> continued her career by transitioning into comedy where she was cast as Angie D'Amao in short-lived ABC sitcom Single Parents. She's had roles in movies like&nbsp;The Roommate&nbsp;and&nbsp;Country Strong, and was recently cast in&nbsp;The Weekend Away.
