He describes his path to salvation and transformation through boxing into ministry as "prophetic." For a thorough overview, we will discuss the particular church of which George Foreman is an active member and provide some relevant history on his personal experience with that congregation.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It also touches upon how influential faith can be to your sense of direction and direct intercession from representatives acting cloaked within the veil of divinity.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How George Foreman Turned to God</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A key seemed to turn for the former popular boxer, George Foreman when he slowly transformed into a devotee of faith. Foreman had a religious epiphany in 1977 after losing to heavyweight Jimmy Young by a decision on March 17 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This meeting caused him to end his boxing career at 28 and dedicate himself to following the Lord. From there, he became an ordained minister, working diligently to share the word of his faith through his church and within many community efforts.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Church of the Lord Jesus</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George Foreman attends "The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ," where he has been preaching since 1980. Based in Houston, Texas, the church has been central to Foreman's religious journey and spiritual courses. Note that this is not associated with any denomination: "The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ"</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Beliefs and Practices</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The church teaches salvation by faith in Jesus Christ and acknowledges the importance of conversion, new birth, and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. Grounded in community outreach and commitment to faith, the church has influenced his conscience as an individual and a Christian.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Community Involvement</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The church that Foreman pastors is not only a worship center used for traditional services but an embedded player in the community who understands how important it is to address trauma from violence with options other than street justice. Whether it was Bible study, prayer time services, or getting together with people from the community, these things centered around spirituality, including fellowship. They were major staples for Foreman and many of his&nbsp;neighbors.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Impact on Foreman's Life and Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Choosing what he felt was his religious destiny of being a minister had altered not only who he perceived himself to be but also the image that made him successful as an iconic sports figure and entrepreneur. Foreman has used his church to inspire and mentor by telling them of his faith journey.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a member of that church, Foreman had strong religious principles and was very active in his community; he also operated the George Foreman Youth and Community Center.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Foreman pointed to his conversion experience as a pivotal moment that shaped both himself and the direction of public influence he would wield through preaching and activism in local communities. His journey is a stark reminder of how powerful faith can be. The ties to religion shape who an individual becomes, their morals and contribution.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miZqLCZo7Rws8SoqaCdXZu8s7HMmqVmmZ6Zeqm10maaoa2imLVurYyjpq6qnprGbrvFZp2aoaSdeqK6w2agp56cqrKvr8Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-foreman-and-his-church-a-journey-of-faith-and-influence.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./larry-the-cable-guy-has-13-shows-in-2023-heres-how-to-get-tickets-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./larry-the-cable-guy-has-13-shows-in-2023-heres-how-to-get-tickets-now.html>Get tickets to see Larry the Cable Guy's 13 comedy shows in 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alex-rodriguez-hangs-out-with-ex-wife-after-jennifer-lopez-split.html>Alex Rodriguez hangs out with ex-wife after Jennifer Lopez split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alex-rodriguez-hangs-out-with-ex-wife-after-jennifer-lopez-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
