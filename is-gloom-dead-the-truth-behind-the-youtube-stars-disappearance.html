Here is everything we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gloom’s Last Video: Signing Off</strong></h2><p>On January 8, 2022, Gloom posted a video titled “Signing Off” on her YouTube channel, which has over 7 million subscribers. In the video, she explained that she was taking a break from YouTube and social media because she was feeling burnt out, stressed, and worried about her health. She revealed that she had found a lump in her breast and feared that she might have cancer, as her family had a history of the disease. She said that she had undergone some tests and was waiting for the results.</p><p>She also said that she was feeling uninspired by the content that she and other creators were making, and that she wanted to take some time off to recharge and rethink her direction. She thanked her fans for their support and love, and assured them that she would be back soon. She ended the video by saying “I love you guys so much, and I’ll see you when I see you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Death Hoax: Is Gloom Dead?</strong></h2><p>Shortly after Gloom posted her last video, some rumors started circulating online that she had passed away. Some websites claimed that she had died of cancer, while others said that she had committed suicide. These rumors were not backed by any evidence or official confirmation, and were likely spread by trolls or clickbait sites.</p><p>However, some fans believed the rumors and expressed their grief and condolences on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. Others tried to debunk the rumors and urged people not to spread false information. Some fans also reached out to Gloom’s friends and collaborators, such as AzzyLand and Jay from the Kubz Scouts, to ask about her condition. However, none of them have responded or addressed the situation publicly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Truth: Gloom is Alive and Well</strong></h2><p>Despite the rumors and speculations, there is no reason to believe that Gloom is dead.

You are enough.” She also encouraged her followers to support other women and uplift each other.</p><p>On April 1, 2022, Gloom posted another story on her Instagram account @gloomykassie, jokingly announcing that she was pregnant with twins. She later clarified that it was an April Fool’s prank, and apologized for any confusion or offense. She also said that she was doing well and thanked her fans for their patience and understanding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Future: When Will Gloom Return?</strong></h2><p>As of now, it is unclear when Gloom will return to YouTube or social media. She has not given any updates on her health issues or her plans for the future.
