A memorial built in 1962 sits above the wreckage. Sixty died on the Utah, and three have been interred there.<h2>Why didn't they get the bodies out of the Arizona?</h2>Caitlin said: “When it was determined that the USS Arizona could not be salvaged, the navy decided that it would be 'too difficult to remove the dead in a respectful manner'. “So 1,102 people remain entombed in the USS Arizona, considered buried at sea.”<h2>U.S. Navy hero, USS Arizona survivor Lieutenant Commander Louis A.

It's believed between 14,000 and 64,000 gallons of oil have leaked from the USS Arizona since the attack, and the National Park Service estimates it could continue to leak for 500 years.<h2>Is Donald Stratton of the USS Arizona still alive?</h2>He was 97 and passed away in his Colorado Springs, Colorado, home surrounded by his wife of nearly seven decades, Velma, and his son, Randy, a Facebook post stated. “One of Donald's final wishes was that people remember Pearl Harbor and the men aboard the USS Arizona.<h2>What ships are still at the bottom of Pearl Harbor?</h2>The target ship USS Utah, and the battleships USS Arizona and Oklahoma, were the only ships the Japanese left beyond repair. The Utah remains on the Pearl Harbor floor along with the Arizona. The Oklahoma was raised after a massive effort but proved to be too damaged to return to service.<h2>Can you dive to the USS Arizona?</h2>Because the Arizona is considered to be a memorial, it is unlawful for divers to enter the ship, so careful egresses are made using underwater rovers that document interior conditions. Members of PVA dive the waters of the USS Arizona along with the National Park Service.<h2>Who was the last person interred on the USS Arizona?</h2>Lauren Bruner is the last survivor of the USS Arizona to have his remains interred on the submerged ship in Pearl Harbor.

Instead, it depicts a flag once displayed at the USNS Vandenberg located in the waters of the Florida Keys.<h2>Were any Japanese remains found at Pearl Harbor?</h2>Oklahoma when it sank during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Using DNA taken from a nephew, the Pentagon was finally able to identify the remains of the 25-year-old sailor in 2020.<h2>Are there still bodies in the USS Oklahoma?</h2>After years of planning, an announcement was made by DPAA that all Oklahoma remains would be exhumed and DNA tested for identification.
