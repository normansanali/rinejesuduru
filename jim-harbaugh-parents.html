<time>06 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As the speculations about Michigan’s head coach, Jim Harbaugh, potentially coaching in the NFL rise, Wolverines’ fans are becoming more restless than ever before, and have turned to the internet looking for answers.</p><p>Throughout all the search queries, one question constantly sticks out: Who are Jim Harbaugh’s parents? Well, we are here to help.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Who_Are_Jim_Harbaughs_Parents><strong>Who Are Jim Harbaugh’s Parents?</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jim-Harbaugh-dad-Jack-Harbaugh.jpg><p>Jim Harbaugh’s parents are Jack and Jacqueline (Jackie) Harbaugh who have played a vital role in shaping the renowned coach he is today. Together they have raised three kids: Jim, John, and Joanie.</p><p>Jack Harbaugh, Jim’s dad, is a veteran coach whose career as a defensive coordinator and assistant coach spans over 45 years. Jack played college football at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) and met his future wife, Jackie, there.</p><p>Jackie Harbaugh was a cheerleader at Bowling Green when she met Jack. Jack recalled that “Jackie sat two rows in front of me in our freshman biology class,” and he “just stumbled around for two years,” before summoning the guts to ask her on a date. The two got married in 1961 after finishing their undergraduate degree.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Where_Do_Jim_Harbaughs_Parents_Live><strong>Where Do Jim Harbaugh’s Parents Live?</strong></span></h2><p>Both Jim and his brother John were born in Toledo, Ohio, where his father Jack was an assistant coach at Perrysburg High School. However, Jim Harbaugh didn’t have one single place he grew up in, due to his father’s coaching career. Jack said this about Jackie in an interview, “She’s the one that moved us 17 times in a 43-year coaching career. She sold houses at every stop and she bought houses at every stop.”</p><p>Here’s the breakdown of various places Jim spent his childhood:</p><ul><li><strong>Eaton, Ohio:</strong> In 1964, Jack was the head coach at Eaton High School.</li><li><strong>Ada, Ohio:</strong> From 1965 to 1967, Jack was an assistant coach at Ohio Northern University.</li><li><strong>Lexington, Kentucky:</strong> In 1968, Jack was an assistant coach at the University of Kentucky.</li><li><strong>Iowa City, Iowa:</strong> In 1969, Jack was an assistant coach at the University of Iowa.</li><li><strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan (1970-1973):</strong> Jack was an assistant coach at the University of Michigan. This is where Jim started playing football and attended Pioneer High School.</li><li><strong>Palo Alto, California (1974-1982):</strong> Jack took a coaching position at Stanford University. Jim attended Palo Alto High School during this time and went on to play college football at Stanford.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jim_Harbaughs_Parents_Ethnicity_and_Religion><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Parents Ethnicity and Religion</strong></span></h2><p>Jim’s mother, Jackie, is half-Sicilian and half-Polish and his father, Jack Harbaugh is German-Irish. Which means Jim is of mixed ethnicity. Nonetheless, Jack and Jackie are both American nationals and citizens.</p><p>Jim Harbaugh is a Roman Catholic and talks openly about his faith and its importance. In 2017, Jim along with the Wolverines team even went to Italy and visited the Vatican.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jim_Harbaughs_Parents_Net_Worth><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Parents Net Worth</strong></span></h2><p>The combined net worth of Jackie and Jack Harbaugh is estimated to be $8 million. Jack, Jim’s father, has had a long and successful career both as a player and a football coach, which is a very rewarding job with a high salary.</p><p>Jim and John Harbaugh, on the other hand, have a higher net worth and annual income in comparison to their father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Jim_Harbaughs_Siblings><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Siblings</strong></span></h2><p>Jim Harbaugh has two siblings: an older brother, John Harbaugh, and a younger sister, Joanie Harbaugh.

Interestingly, John and Jim faced each other as head coaches in Super Bowl XLVII, which marked the first time in NFL history that brothers had coached against each other in the Super Bowl.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Joani_Harbaugh><strong>Joani Harbaugh</strong></span></h3><p>Born in 1965, Joani is the youngest child of the football coach Jack Harbaugh, who eventually married Tom Crean, the young basketball assistant, now the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers, adding another coach to the family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2><p>The Harbaugh family has a long and deep-rooted history with Bowling Green State University. It’s the same place where Jack and Jackie met and got married. It’s the same place where all of their three kids studied. Jack even went back to BGSU as a coach after some years. According to the Harbaughs, it’s one of the most cherished places that they hold dear to their heart as it made them fall in love with football and family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunCvzqWjnp%2BVYrOwu9ObmKWkX5%2B2rnnHmqmbmaWctW68wKucp6yjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-harbaugh-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jon-barinholtz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jon-barinholtz.html>Jon Barinholtz Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mom-editor-picks-spring-fashion-nordstrom-8606708.html>I'm My Mom's Personal Shopper, and I'm Styling Her for Spring</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mom-editor-picks-spring-fashion-nordstrom-8606708.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
