So, he knew he had to share his story with the world and let everyone taste his delicious recipes when he got the chance to participate in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The American Barbecue Showdown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he had to keep his participation a secret for over a year as the show was delayed by almost 2 years after being announced. Following the country’s “best backyard smokers and competitive barbecuers as they compete for the title of American Barbecue Champion,” the show’s second installment graced </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Netflix</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> again on May 26, 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Like the inaugural season, the second season followed contestants as they take on a challenge that tests their barbecue skills in ways “they couldn’t possibly imagine. From unique meats to old school techniques, they will have to prove they have the skills to smoke another day.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining John Boy for the competition were his co-stars Thyron Mathews, Cindy Hayter, Delilah Winder, Michelle Lundstrom, Joey Victorian, Eduardo Gonzalez, and Logan Sandoval.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though John Boy hit the spotlight via </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The American Barbecue Showdown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, it wasn’t the first time he appeared on a TV show. Prior to this, he was one of the first competitors on a new Discovery+ show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners: Smoke Ring</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in which Steven Ray Tickle, from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, hunted for the best pitmasters in the South.</span></p><h3><b>John Boy Caddell Career</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>John Boy Caddell has been cooking ever since he was five — learning from his mom, grandma, and great-grandma, who were all exceptional cooks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, along the way, he lost track and got into alcoholism.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After 20 years of struggle, John Boy then decided it was time to “straighten my life,” and started searching to do “something with his time, something that would benefit the community.” Then, he got in touch with his cousin Earn, who instilled a passion for BBQ in him, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>started JohnBoy’s BBQ</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, a barbecue spot off Highway 62 in Morgan County, and also hired those in recovery.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I wanted to put my time to good use and part of your recovery is through service work and I believe we’re doing a great service to our community by putting people to work and teaching,” said John Boy.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Initially, they were only open the last Saturday of every month, but have since increased their frequency due to popularity.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what did he do the other days? “I go out to the jail on Friday nights and we speak with inmates out there and I attend AA meetings,” he shared. “We’ve got several people that come out and help.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of his employees, Kevin Anderson’s daughter, a recovering addict, said, “It’s just nice to have a place where she can come and she’s safe. Everybody here is a good influence and it’s not the normal people she would be hanging out with the people who are using.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Find Johnboys BBQ on FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>JohnboysBBQsweet29</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>BbqJohnboy</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>John Boy has already graced two music videos.</span></p><h3><b>John Boy Caddell Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>John Boy Caddell comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His father, John Caddell is a Former Electrician/Technical Specialist who worked at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Y-12 National Security Complex</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
