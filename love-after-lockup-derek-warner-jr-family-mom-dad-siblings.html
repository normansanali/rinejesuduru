Who are his parents? Does he have any siblings? How old are they and where do they live?</p><p>Here’s what we’ve discovered on the web. So, tag along and learn all that we know about him.</p><h3><strong>Love After Lockup: Who Are Derek Warner Jr Family Members?</strong></h3><p>Derek Warner Jr. was born to his dad Derek Warner in October 1992. In 2022, he is the star of WETV’s hit show Love After Lockup appearing in season 5 of the show. His relationship with his girlfriend Monique Robinson is one of the relationships the show chronicled.</p><p>Through a Facebook forum for inmate pen pals, Monique met Derek. Upon seeing Derek’s picture, Monique was compelled to message him. In one video, Monique described how she came into a jail pen pal group while just scrolling through Facebook because it was late and she couldn’t sleep. Derek also developed feelings for Monique once they started talking and wanted to go serious.</p><p>They are still together after two years. However, their family disapproves of the union. Even Monique’s friends are not pleased with her romantic relationship or her friendship with Derek. This couple’s issue is that they have never actually met.</p><p>If Derek gets released from prison, Monique worries about how their relationship might evolve. When Monique claimed to share Derek’s love of exercise, she was lying. She worried about how he will react when they first meet.</p><p>Monique, however, believes Derek had an impact on her choice to seek weight-loss surgery. She also admitted to her pals that when Derek gets released from prison in a few days, she is worried about what he will think of her when they first meet. Monique clarified to her pals, “I’m nervous. It does cross my mind, like what if, you know, I’m not what he imagined, or what if he [doesn’t] like me? I’m trying to think positive, but it’s hard when y’all are being so negative.”</p><p>People who viewed the new season’s episodes were quick to claim that Monique catfished Derek. Soon after, Monique joined the conversation on Instagram to address the catfish charges. She wrote, “Now I done let y’all play with me on this internet long enough. I hate how Love After Lockup trying to push this narrative like I’m catfishing a man in prison. I use filters on pics like every other woman. Also, I gave y’all plenty of pics to choose from when y’all did my intro and y’all did not use ONE full body pic.”</p><p>She added, “Why is that??? Like I was sending nothing but filtered selfies for 2 1/2 years? 🙄 be fuckin fr!! I’ve always been a confident BBW. Y’all cannot bully me or fat shame me because I know who tf I am!! Stop the bullshit.&nbsp; #loveafterlockup&nbsp; #loveafterlockupwetv.”</p><h3><strong>Meet Love After Lockup Derek Warner Jr Mom</strong></h3><p>Despite looking for all the connections that were available on the web, we weren’t able to unearth information about Love After Lockup Derek Warner Jr.’s mom.</p><h3><strong>Meet Love After Lockup Derek Warner Jr Dad</strong></h3><p>Derek Warner Jr.’s father is named Derek Warner.
