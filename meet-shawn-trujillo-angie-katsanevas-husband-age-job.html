So, some of us remember her from back then. And because Bravo introduces her also as a wife and mother, here’s what we know about her husband who goes around as Shawn Trujillo.</p><h3><strong>Meet Shawn Trujillo, RHOSLC Star Angie Katsanevas Husband</strong></h3><p>Shawn Trujillo and RHOSLC star Angie Katsanevas have been married since July 17th of 1999. Since then, many a lot of beautiful things happened to them on the day 17th.</p><p>Shawn, citing that the number 17 is his lucky number, once wrote on social media that he was born on the 17th, their daughter was also born on the 17th and were together for 17 years when they had her.</p><p>Shawn and Angie were 25 and 28 years old when they started on their journey together. Two young kids chasing a dream, Shawn said looking back. He said they were willing to do the work, and believed that together as a team, they could make anything happen. To put it simply, they were two young kids, who met in a hair salon and fell in love sometime around 1995.</p><p>While on Father’s Day, it was Angie’s turn to gush about her husband being the best dad to their daughter, Elektra.</p><p>Talking about the science behind choosing one’s mate Angie said as a wild 21-year-old, she was intuitively choosing the future father of her daughter. Handsome, strong, determined, focused, competitive, integral, with big muscles, big goals, and big dreams, Angie worded that, Shawn wanted to be the best at everything he did and when presented to become a Father he did just that.</p><p>Recalling Elektra as a newborn baby, born on 17 May 2022, Shawn shared that she came into this world at 7:59 a.m., weighing in at 5.1. A delicate doll-like baby, he said did not cry and was just batting her long eyelashes, staring back at him and bringing her new Mom to tears. Fast forward to today, and she is a champion Equestrian.</p><p>About his daughter, Shawn also gushed that his “little animal lover” has already planned to own a Ranch and train horses one day after qualifying as an equestrian in the Olympics.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Trujillo Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1970, Shawn Trujillo reached the age of 51 in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Trujillo Job</strong></h3><p>RHOSLC star Angie Katsanevas and her husband also are business partners.

The business, that he co-founds with his life partner, may seem like an overnight success now. But there have been 20-plus years of trying and perseverance involved here. The same year they got married, they had decided to open a little salon in a 700-square-foot cottage across Trolley Square. As of 2022 and it has established itself as a fast-growing nationwide salon network branching into nine outlets in Utah, Idaho, and Ohio.</p><p>And so like that, Lunatic Fringe Salons, founded by two young hairdressers, is now a nationally recognized brand.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Shawn Trujillo’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Shawn Trujillo was reportedly standing above $5 million net worth as of 2022.</p><p>His resume here also goes on to introduce him as a business development professional with an OPM/ALD focused in Business from Harvard Business School.
