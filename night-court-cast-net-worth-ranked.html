Viewers loved the hysterical take on the legal system, and the actors and actresses that brought the story to life. Now, over three decades later, NBC has created a sequel series of the beloved show. This follows the trend in television of rebooting or recreating older television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The original cast included Harry Anderson, John Larroquette, and more.
