Okay, my friend, you have a paid-off car and I know you're seeing all your friends driving their nice new cars, their 2022s, 2023s, listen."</p><p>She then began to delineate the specific financial position that folks with a paid-off car are in and that seeing their friends in shiny, nice, new whips is not all that it's cracked up to be: "I know you see it. I know you're watching them take their photos and post them on Facebook about...got my nice new car waving their keys in the air thanking the whatever people are that sell cars, car salesmen, whatever."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jesgragghampton href=#>@jesgragghampton</a><p>a little dirt dont hurt</p><a title="♬ original sound - Jes Gragg Hampton" href=#>♬ original sound - Jes Gragg Hampton</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @jesgragghampton</span></figure><p>The TikToker encourages folks who own their vehicles outright to not succumb to social media envy with folks boasting about their new wheels online: "You might be driving a car that's 10 or 15 years old, it might be an old beater, you might have a bunch of stains on your seats. It might smell a little funny when you turn the heat on."</p><p>Resist the temptation to upgrade, she says, despite not packing some features that have been standard in even entry-level trim vehicles for the past few years: "You probably don't have a backup camera but like, who needs that anyway? I just want to encourage you and remind you: you don't need a new car."</p><p>She doubled down, reminding folks that even though they may not have the newest car, they have something much more valuable — another monthly financial burden: "You don't have a car payment. You don't need a new car. You don't have a car payment."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jesgragghampton</span></figure><p>Jes went on to say that getting jealous of people in their life who have a brand spanking new vehicle is no reason to go out and get themselves a new car payment: "Don't let your friends fool you. They're paying $500 a month for their new car, okay? And you're sitting here with no payments. So just, just keep that in your brain."</p><p>Throngs of TikTokers who saw her video agreed with her advice. One person wrote: "You don’t need a car payment!! Say it louder"</p><p>Another said that they enjoyed paying their car off more than that first feeling of getting a new whip: "the feeling of having a paid off car is far more exciting than i’ve ever felt getting a new car."</p><p>One TikToker said that they would rather pay the maintenance costs for a vehicle they don't owe money on every single year as it ultimately costs less than a new car payment: "Truth! I’d rather pay $1k-2k a year to maintain my paid off car then $500 a month for a new car plus extra insurance for a financed car"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jesgragghampton</span></figure><p>For someone else, however, these maintenance and repair bills for an older car is way too costly: "'You don't have a car payment' you have a mechanic payment, a tow payment, a repair payment"</p><p>Depending on which vehicle you own, either of the aforementioned TikTokers could be correct as there are some manufacturers and models that age better than others.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Land Rovers, for instance, carry notoriously hefty repair costs</a> and a slew of out of warranty problems. And while it might be tempting to get a used BMW that's surpassed its threshold for the manufacturer's warranty, after all, it's a beamer! You're probably better off staying away from it as repairs for these whips can easily climb into the thousands of dollars whenever you bring it in.</p><p>And if you're thinking of going the electric route, unless the battery has been recently replaced or is covered under a decent enough number of miles so you could at least drive it for a few years before plunking down on repairs, you'll probably want to stay away from any used EV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jesgragghampton</span></figure><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla battery, for instance, can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 to replace or repair</a>. If you absolutely want to purchase a used EV, again, see how long the warranty is available for your battery or get yourself a used <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chevy Bolt EV or EUV</a> — many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have had their batteries swapped out</a> allowing drivers to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make the most out of its 8-year, 100,000 mile battery warranty</a>.</p><p>And while Jes makes a point about not having a car payment, if your vehicle is one of those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyotas or Hondas that just won't die</a>, but you don't want to miss out on fancy new features, you're actually in luck.</p><p>If you have an older vehicle with a simple radio setup, you can often easily install a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party Android Auto/Apple Car Play</a> car set up, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an adjustable back up camera</a> and bluetooth microphone rigged up to your vehicle, all for less than it would probably cost you for two months of a new car payment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jesgragghampton</span></figure><p>Have a little extra money to spend and want to make the cabin in your vehicle quieter? You can also get <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sound dampening panels</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">maybe even upgrade the sound system while you're at it</a>.</p><p>New floor mats and high quality seat covers, or a good cleaning of the interior and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">using a bit of elbow grease to remove the oxidation from your headlights</a> will get your car feeling like a brand new ride — without having to finance an entirely new vehicle.</p><p>The best part is you can do the upgrades piecemeal and whenever you have the money for it.</p><p>Again though, that's considering your car is getting you to where you need to go. Do you agree with Jes' advice? Or do you think that sometimes getting a new car is simply unavoidable?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6qsIyonZ9lk5a%2Fbq7Eraueql2ptaK6jKecsA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaid-off-car-better-than-new.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./american-idol-winners-2013234.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./american-idol-winners-2013234.html>'American Idol' Winners Through the Years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html>Who Is Wladimir Klitschko's Ex-Wife Aleksandra?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
