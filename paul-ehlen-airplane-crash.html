He was flying a vintage World War II-era aircraft that he had restored himself, when it suffered a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff from Hamilton Airport in Montana. He was the only person on board and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Paul Ehlen?</h2><p>Paul Ehlen was a successful entrepreneur and a passionate aviator. He started Precision Lens in the early 1990s and grew it into one of the leading distributors of intraocular lenses and other products for cataract surgery in the Midwest. He also founded the American Wings Air Museum, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving and displaying historic military aircraft. He owned several vintage planes, including a P-40E Warhawk, a P-51D Mustang, a F4U Corsair, and a B-25 Mitchell bomber.</p><p>Ehlen was known for his generosity and his love of adventure. He often invited friends, family, and colleagues to join him on his flights or to visit his museum. He also sponsored several charitable causes, such as the Honor Flight Network, which transports veterans to Washington D.C. to visit memorials. He was married and had three children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Paul Ehlen’s plane?</h2><p>According to witnesses and authorities, Ehlen’s plane, a P-40E Warhawk, crashed shortly after takeoff from Hamilton Airport around 8:07 a.m. on Tuesday, June 27. The plane had just lifted off the runway when it veered to the right and plunged into the ground, bursting into flames. The cause of the crash is still under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).</p><p>The P-40E Warhawk was a single-engine fighter plane used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. It was known for its distinctive shark-mouth nose art and its role in the Flying Tigers squadron that fought against Japan in China. Ehlen had acquired the plane in 2017 from another collector and had spent years restoring it to its original condition. He had flown it several times before and had planned to fly it back to Minneapolis on Tuesday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the impact of Paul Ehlen’s death?</h2><p>Paul Ehlen’s death has shocked and saddened many people who knew him or admired him. His family, friends, and employees have expressed their grief and condolences on social media and in statements to the press. His customers and partners have also praised his professionalism and integrity in the medical industry. His fellow aviation enthusiasts have honored his legacy and his contribution to preserving history.</p><p>Ehlen’s death has also raised questions about the safety and regulation of vintage aircraft. Some experts have argued that flying such planes is inherently risky and requires special skills and maintenance. Others have defended the hobby as a valuable way to educate and inspire people about aviation history. The FAA and the NTSB are expected to release their findings on the crash in the coming months.</p><p>Paul Ehlen was a remarkable person who lived a full and adventurous life. He was a successful businessman, a generous philanthropist, and a passionate aviator. He died doing what he loved: flying a vintage plane that he had restored himself. His death is a tragic loss for his family, his company, his community, and his fellow aviation enthusiasts. He will be remembered for his achievements, his spirit, and his legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGilnq%2BjZL2iwctmnKGklaN6orXRqaOappVisLOt0qFm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-ehlen-airplane-crash.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./william-distelcamp-cause-of-death-liquid-hair-salon-in-east-brunswick-founder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./william-distelcamp-cause-of-death-liquid-hair-salon-in-east-brunswick-founder.html>William Distelcamp Cause of Death , Liquid Hair Salon in East BrunswickFounder</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-shoes-to-wear-to-coachella-3568700.html>Tips For A Comfortable Music Festival Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-shoes-to-wear-to-coachella-3568700.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
