Is she married?</p><p>Learn more about Polly Brindle in this article.</p><h3><strong>Polly Brindle On Netflix’s Selling The OC</strong></h3><p>On August 24, 2022, Netflix released the first episode of “Selling the OC,” a spinoff of Selling Sunsets. Eleven recent alumni who are luxury waterfront property agents in Orange County, California, are the focus of the curriculum. The cast of “Selling Sunset” The Oppenheim Group, a brokerage run by Jason and Brett Oppenheim, reportedly expanded to cover Newport Beach in 2021, according to the Real Deal. They brought a totally new group of agents with them.</p><p>In addition, Polly is one of the 11 attractive and accomplished agents that will be on the show.</p><p>Alex Hall, Alexandra Rose, Alexandra Jarvis, Austin Victoria, Gio Helou, Kayla Cardona, Brandi Marshall, Tyler Stanaland, Sean Palmieri, and Lauren Brito are some of the other participants on this eight-episode voyage with her.</p><h3><strong>Polly Brindle Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Polly Brindle’s thriving career with a net worth of above $1 million.</p><p>When Polly was spotted as a model in her native England at the age of 15, she began working professionally. She then enjoyed a successful two-decade modeling career that brought her into contact with illustrious companies like Lancôme, Dior, and Aston Martin.</p><p>Because of her line of work, Polly had the opportunity to visit cities like London, Paris, Milan, and Barcelona, which sparked a lifelong passion for architecture and design in her.</p><p>After relocating, Polly began to actively engage in the business and design industries, which aided in the development of her skills. She used to work as a Senior Business Manager for a Luxe Apparel company, which gave her the chance to hone her interpersonal skills in a group setting. Then, as she gained experience in negotiation through her position as a member of the management team at a boutique architecture business, her desire to assist her clients grew.</p><p>Polly obtained her real estate agent license (DRE# 02141467) on May 25, 2021, allowing her to work with properties in the state of California. Polly’s employment as a real estate agent at The Oppenheim Group appears to be the first ever.

She frequently collaborated with her coworkers to close agreements as quickly as possible and was the first person to ring the bell in the reality show’s inaugural season.</p><p>Per her IMDB, Polly has worked as an actress in movies like The Glass Man, Punch, Rush, Jingle Dead II, and Sovereign.</p><h3><strong>Is Polly Brindle Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Polly Brindle isn’t married now but she did once.

In the first episode of the series, she revealed, “I was married all of my twenties,” at a meal with the cast (“Paradise Comes with a Price”). “Like, I was playing like the wifey, doing that thing.”</p><p>Polly said that it was more dramatic than that when Austin questioned whether she and her ex-boyfriend had broken up because they each wanted to “go their separate ways.”</p><p>No, she responded and then added, “it was a plane crash ending”. Polly went into greater detail in her confessional about what she meant when she said, “Plane crash ending.” “We took vows, and I took those vows very seriously. I got married for the rest of my life, and he was unfaithful, “In her interview, she stated. “His phone included images of him with two ladies, which I viewed. They were prostitutes.”</p><p>Her own experience with infidelity triggered her in the show. Polly was particularly outraged by Kayla’s treatment of married co-star Tyler Stanaland on the show. Polly didn’t specifically mention her husband on the Netflix show, but her Instagram feed does offer some information about who he might be.</p><p>The app was used by Polly to share a post in January 2017 honoring Stephen Wolf, the “hottest husband,” on his birthday. Three years later, in January 2020, she wrote another post honoring his 40th birthday and referred to him as “birthday bae.”</p><p>Stephen could be seen on Polly’s Instagram as early as October 2012.
