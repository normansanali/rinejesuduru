The lyrics describe his memories of moments with her, from drawing daisies together in the sand, to teaching her how to drive. Despite their shared experiences and love, she left him and he can't seem to understand why. The chorus repeats the sentiment that the moon and back isn't that far, as if to say that he would have done anything for her, yet she still chose to leave. The song's melancholic tone is communicated through the singer's tough exterior- he still parties with his buddies and puts on a good show for the town, but ultimately he misses his love and is struggling to move on.</p><br><p>The lyrics of "Moon and Back" are a reflection of a timeless theme: heartbreak. The song illustrates the idea that sometimes love isn't enough to keep a relationship together. This song demonstrates the interplay between memories and present moment, with the singer constantly oscillating between the two. The lyrics "my eyes are still the shade of blue, still got calluses on my hand" serve as a metaphor, where the physical traits act as reminders of his past love. With an understated melody, a simple chord progression, and emotive lyrics, the Read Southall Band captures the universal experience of heartbreak and the struggle for closure.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I'm trying to close my eyes, you know</u><br>I am attempting to avoid thinking about you</p><br><p><u>I tried so hard but it just kinda sting</u><br>Despite my attempts, thoughts of you still cause me pain</p><br><p><u>I still remember ole bitter creek</u><br>I recall a specific place and time with you</p><br><p><u>Had a hand of daisies</u><br>I held a bouquet of flowers</p><br><p><u>Drew 'em out in the sand would you be with me and you said yes</u><br>I asked you to be with me and you agreed</p><br><p><u>I still remember your daddy's jeep</u><br>I have a vivid memory of your father's vehicle</p><br><p><u>You'd right in there next to me</u><br>You would sit beside me in the jeep</p><br><p><u>You weren't very good at a five speed, so I taught you</u><br>You struggled with shifting the gears, and I helped you learn</p><br><p><u>So, why did you leave?</u><br>I question why you departed from my life</p><br><p><u>'Cause it don't make no sense to me</u><br>I cannot comprehend the reason for your absence</p><br><p><u>My friends say I'm still a good time</u><br>My companions believe that I am still enjoyable to be around</p><br><p><u>People still say I can dance</u><br>I am still recognized as a good dancer by others</p><br><p><u>And my daddy's still my best friend</u><br>My father remains my closest confidant</p><br><p><u>And I still starch my shirts and pants</u><br>I have not changed my habit of heavily ironing my clothes</p><br><p><u>I still believe in the Word of God</u><br>My faith in God remains steadfast</p><br><p><u>And I'm still chasing all our plans</u><br>I am pursuing the same goals we once shared</p><br><p><u>And my eyes are still that shade of blue</u><br>My eye color has not changed</p><br><p><u>Still got calluses on my hand</u><br>I continue to have rough spots on my hands from playing guitar</p><br><p><u>Yeah, my hair is still long and shaggy</u><br>My hairstyle remains the same</p><br><p><u>And I still love to pick guitar</u><br>I still have a passion for playing the guitar</p><br><p><u>You said you loved everything about me</u><br>You claimed to adore every aspect of my being</p><br><p><u>I guess the moon and back it ain't that far</u><br>I realize that the moon is not actually that far away, compared to my love for you</p><br><p><u>Lay and stare at the ceiling a while</u><br>I lay down and gaze at the ceiling for a period of time</p><br><p><u>Live a pretty rough lifestyle</u><br>I tend to live a challenging way of life</p><br><p><u>That you're gone I do just about anything I want to</u><br>Without you here, I am free to do as I please</p><br><p><u>My buddys' love having me around</u><br>My friends enjoy my presence</p><br><p><u>Hide the pain from the whole damn town</u><br>I conceal my emotional distress from everyone else</p><br><p><u>But the truth is and always will be that I miss you</u><br>Despite my efforts to hide it, I still yearn for your presence</p><br><p><u>Guess the moon and back is far enough for me</u><br>I have come to accept that loving you from afar is enough for me</p><br><p><u>It ain't that far</u><br>Distance does not matter when it comes to my love for you</p><br><p><u>It ain't that far</u><br>Despite physical distance, my love for you remains close</p><br><p><u>I guess the moon and back it ain't that far</u><br>My love for you is so strong that distance does not tarnish it</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Writer(s): Robert Read Southall</span></p><p>Contributed by Caden T.
