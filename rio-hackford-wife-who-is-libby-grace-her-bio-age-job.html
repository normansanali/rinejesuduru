His brother Alex Hackford confirmed that he died on 14 April 2022.</p><p>Helen and Taylor both mourned the loss of their son. Helen posted on Instagram, “El Rio” alongside his photograph. She married his father in 1997.</p><p>Helen and Taylor made their first comments about Rio’s death. In a statement sent to TODAY, the director and actor said they “are both inspired by the life of our son and stepson, Rio Hackford, and heartbroken by his loss.”</p><p>“His life showed us how to live in generosity and community,” the couple said. “He shared his life’s journey with so many who now mourn him, and at the same time, celebrate their fortune in knowing him.”</p><p>Learn more about Rio Hackford’s wife below in this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Rio Hackford Wife, Libby Grace</strong></h3><p>Rio Hackford was married to his wife, Libby Grace. They reportedly tied the knots in 2015. Per Rio’s Facebook post, they had been together since 2012.</p><p>The married couple welcomed their son Waylon Jack on 19 November 2012. They also welcomed their second son Buck James in 2020.</p><p>“The Mandalorian,” “Swingers,” “The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story” and “Jonah Hex” are some of the high-profile works of Rio Hackford. Moreover, he also played a manager in Hulu’s “Pam & Tommy.”</p><p>Besides that, Rio was the owner of several bars such as The Matador, One-Eyed Jacks and Pals in New Orleans, The Monty and The Eldorado in Los Angeles, The Grasshopper in Long Beach, and The Homestead in San Francisco according to his Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Libby Grace Age</strong></h3><p>Rio Hackford, who died at the age of 51, is survived by his wife Libby Grace, who appears to be below 40 years old as of 2022.</p><h3><strong>Libby Grace Job</strong></h3><p>By profession, Libby Grace is a music composer. She stirred conversation for the first time after collaborating with Joshua Homme’s motley crew Desert Sessions. She gave her vocals in the song “If You Run”, directed by her late husband Rio Hackford.</p><p>“If You Run” stars Joshua and DS newcomer Libby Grace as a mysterious hitchhiker, following them on a sinister trip through the Joshua Tree desert, culminating in a freakishly hallucinatory finale set at the famed Rancho De La Luna studio. Hackford’s “If You Run” visualization also stars DS collaborators Billy Gibbons, Dave Catching, Matt Sweeney, Stella Mozgawa, and Carla Azar.</p><p>Her husband revealed to <a href=#>DIY</a>, “The video was inspired by Josh bringing an unknown Libby Grace into the Dessert Sessions arena to show her haunting magic to the world.”</p><p>He added, “Homme, Sweeney, and I are some of the only people who have heard Libby’s music, so the idea of them introducing her to the players and recording process lit the fuse. The song lent itself perfectly to the lonesome desert landscape and the spell that the Rancho can cast on anyone that passes through its doors.”</p><p>Libby joined Desert Sessions as a guitarist, vocalist, and singer-songwriter. She is a family friend of Joshua Homme and invited Libby to join the band to take a break from full-time mom duties and give it a shot.</p><p>Libby started playing guitar and writing songs as a kid. But, she has always been put off by the idea of public performance. The laid-back process of the Desert Sessions (DS), and working with people she already knew socially, made it a gentle baptism.</p><p>“What it did for me, ’cause it’s so different from what my life is, is that it showed me another version of myself that exists that I need to feed,” Libby told GQ. “That it can exist, and so can mom and so can wife.”</p><p>However, many of the fans of the band believed that it was Lady Gaga and Libby was just the face on the video. Fans had a long discussion on <a href=#>Reddit</a> claiming it was the Poker Face singer who sang that song because of the similarity in their voice and Libby’s lack of profile in the public domain.</p><p>Whereas, others claimed that it was PJ Harvey (<a href=#>@pjharveyofficial</a>) in disguise.</p><p>But, one person on Reddit who knew her personally claimed, “<span>I know her. She’s a very private, talented, down-to-earth, wife, mother, beyond beautiful inside and out.</span><span>“</span></p><h3><strong>Is Libby Grace On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>As stated, Libby Grace is extremely private. She doesn’t seem to be on any of the social media platforms. Although she features on her husband’s Facebook, she doesn’t seem to have one. The only social media account she seems to be on is Instagram (<a href=#>@iamlibbygrace</a>).</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Libby Grace From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Libby Grace, although, she lives in Sunset Beach, California, could be a native of New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Libby Grace?</strong></h4></li></ul><span>Libby Grace Stands tall around the height of 5 feet 8 inches.</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmq6GfYrWir8qfpqucXay2p7GMsJ%2BoZZmoeq21wZuwZp%2BilrCmeceeqWaamaR6orPEZqGoml8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frio-hackford-wife-who-is-libby-grace-her-bio-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./night-at-the-museum-who-is-sebastian-yatra-singer-appears-on-gary-barlows-music-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./night-at-the-museum-who-is-sebastian-yatra-singer-appears-on-gary-barlows-music-show.html>Night At The Museum: Who is Sebastian Yatra?
