After the trip, Margo started feeling unwell, so she booked a doctor’s appointment.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I will never forget what I thought when the doctor told me the news,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. “The first thing that ran through my mind was, ‘I don’t want to die.’ I had just been told that I had cervical cancer. Cancer? But I thought that it was nothing serious? How is this possible? The gynecologist couldn’t tell us much about my cancer; all she could tell me is that I had always done everything right. But if I did everything right, then why am I sitting here? … I had just been told that I had cancer, but now I wished more than anything that I could go back to not knowing, go back to what I considered ‘normal.’”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She got married in August 2012.</h2><p>Margo and Derek had a <a href=#>destination wedding</a>, tying the knot in Punta Cana on Aug. 8, 2012. “Every time I feel like I can’t get through another day, I picture myself marrying Derek on the beach,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a>. “I know that this is what we deserve, and what is going to make us both happy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And TLC cameras were rolling when Margo — dressed in her $2,500 Alita Graham gown — said her “I do’s” with Derek. “I’m feeling great. I got to marry the love of my life today. She looks gorgeous,” the groom said on the show.</p><p>Added Margo, “Our wedding symbolizes no matter what anyone throws at us, we will still stand by each other’s side.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Margo passed away the following month.</h2><p>Margo’s mother, Hilliary, announced Margo’s death on her daughter’s blog, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, “My beautiful, kind, generous, artistic, thoughtful, innocent, newlywed daughter lost her all-too-brief battle with cancer on Sept. 21, 2012. … Margo spent her last hours battling this horrific disease with every ounce of her being, just as she did every day since receiving her diagnosis in December of 2011.”</p><p>Hilliary also spoke to her daughter’s resilience. “Margo never wanted to hear the odds she was up against and faced every appointment, surgery, treatment, and scan with a smile on her face, making friends along the way. … I continue to miss my Margo deeply and struggle daily to find my way in a world void of her scrunched-nose smile. … We were not given a choice about Margo’s illness or the outcome, but we do have a choice as to what we will do with our pain. … We can let it tear us apart, or we can let it bring out greatness. I know what Margo is cheering for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK66edieqmasn2LBqbGMnameq6NiuqK%2BxqhknaGVmQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2000s-celebrity-couples-ruled-hollywood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2000s-celebrity-couples-ruled-hollywood.html>2000's Celebrity Couples Who Ruled Hollywood</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-tony-leungs-net-worth.html>What is Tony Leungs Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-tony-leungs-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
