The recieving partner lays back and the penetrating partner enters from above, offering the benefit of getting some grinding clitoral stimulation along with the internal stimulation you can control with shallow or deeper thrusts.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Doggy Style</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/69-sex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.jpg><p>Doggy style is a classic for a reason! Bestial and intense, there are a lot of modifications to give the giver and reciever something they’ll enjoy. Entry from behind and the openness of the hips give a good shot at G-spot penetration. The penetrating partner is standing or kneeling with their hands free to roam, grope, and grip to their heart’s content.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48466981132075><h2>Pushing Tush</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/modified-coital-01.png><p>Butt-lovers rejoice! The Pushing Tush sex position helps both the penetrating and recieving partner play around with the back door, and it’s a great choice if your partner has expressed interest in playing around with anal penetration in a less-intimidating way. For added fun, you can <a href=#>add some toys</a> (a good lube is your best friend here!) for something extra powerful.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.95114942528736><h2>The Butterfly</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/doggy-style-sex-position.jpg><p>Another way to <a href=#>modify missionary</a> with a bit more power, the Butterfly sex position involves having the recieving partner lay back on a slightly elevated surface (bed, table, countertop, go off!) tilting their hips upward and offering cervical stimulation and free hands for clitoral activities.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Countertop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pushing-tush-03.png><p>For that sweeping-off-the-countertop (or desk) <a href=#>hot sex moment</a> that you’ve totally fantasized about, the Countertop sex position can utilize just about any flat surface that is the right height for the penetrating partner. Take turns controlling the depth of penetration (the receiving partner can adjust their legs at their partners shoulders as well) and you’ll both be seeing stars.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3515228426396><h2>Happy Scissors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-butterfly-position-02.png><p>Another one that is excellent for any flat surface, the sweet, wide-open energy of the Happy Scissors sex position is totally erotic. Again, the penetrating partner can adjust depth depending on how they support the recieving partners legs. It also gives access to other <a href=#>erogenous zones down the legs and feet,</a> for folks who are into that.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3243606998654><h2>Uncloak the Clitoris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/04-counter-top.png><p>The Uncloak the Clitoris sex position is here to remind you that you’re never too cool for hand stuff. Another reminder: the vast majority of people with vulvas can’t orgasm from penetration alone (which is totally fine — and orgasm isn’t the point of good sex anyway!). But if you are looking to help your partner get off, keeping your hands free to <a href=#>give their clitoris some love</a> is an expert move.</p><p>The clit is a super sensitive part of the body with more than 8,000 nerve endings in the tip alone, so giving it some gentle — and ideally, lubricated! — swirls, circles, and strokes is the easiest way to up your game as a lover. Just ask your partner what they like best!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.96449704142012><h2>Rocking Horse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05-happy-scissors.png><p>The Rocking Horse will become your new fave for <a href=#>G-spot stimulation</a> and intimate eye-contact. In this position, the receiving partner sits between the penetrating partner’s legs, with the receiving partner’s legs just short of wrapped around them (but you can modify for that if you want to go full Koala!). Both partners rock into each other, which gives you a lot of room to control the depth of penetration while also holding each other super close.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Seated Scissors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06-unleash-the-clit.png><p>Getting the receiving partner on top is a great way to give them a boost of control (and to give the penetrating partner a hell of a view). In the Seated Scissors position, the partner recieving can straddle the penetrating partner with one leg between theirs and one outside their hip, allowing some extra angles and creative ranges of motion while also giving some additional grinding options for clitoral stimulation.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Baring the Scepter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rocking-horse-sex-position.jpg><p>If you don’t have a cool penis ring on hand, never fear! Baring the Sceptor is a position that can elicit that same intense reaction for partners with penises. Simply form a ring with your thumb and forefinger around the base of the penis, pull down so the skin of the shaft is taut and enjoy the increased sensitivity and sensations that follow. If you can keep your hand there during intercourse, it’s a sure way to level-up penetrative sex.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.4077598828697><h2>Spooning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/seated-scissors.png><p>Lazy lovers, we see you and hear you. Particularly on slow mornings, there are few things that hit like a morning tussle with your partner. Spooning (yes, like the cuddling position) can easily become a top-10 favorite sex position when the penetrating partner steps up into the big spoon role and enters the partner being penetrated from behind. Hands remain free for touch and clitoral stimulation and mouth remains free for kisses and dirty talk.&nbsp;</p><p>And, best of all, when you’re all done there’s not much else to do but snuggle up and fall back to sleep for a few. (But remember to pee after sex. <a href=#>Nobody wants a UTI</a> over here.)&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.4528130671506><h2>Hands Behind Ankles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/baring-the-scepter.png><p>Entering into the kinky portion of our list, Hands Behind Ankles is a position that requires a <a href=#>comfortable pair of cuffs</a>, a good deal of flexibility, and <a href=#>some pre-game discussio</a>n. Make sure the partner being cuffed is comfortable, sort out safe words (a red, yellow, green stoplight system is cool but stopping when you hear “stop” is always a good place to start, NGL) and plan out <a href=#>some cozy aftercare</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now on to the position: Sort of a Yoga meets hogtie move (unless you get a set up of cuffs that accomodate ankles, I suppose), you’ll want to have the partner being penetrated/cuffed lie down with their belly to the floor and bend their legs up. Reaching back for their feet, attach the cuffs around the wrists so they sit behind their ankles. With a little careful maneuvering, have the penetrating partner slide in between your back and ankles. (Or, when in doubt, bust out a toy!) With the penetrated partner’s hips open, the stretch also brings a bit of extra blood to your pelvis allowing for a highly stimulating experience.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Self-Loving (On Your Knees)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1spooning-sex-position.jpg><p>Whether you’re flying solo or are showing your partner some of what you like, a solid go-to masturbation position (like grinding on a firm pillow or a toy) can be an excellent way to heighten pleasure. Straddling said pillow (or your lover’s thigh, go off) makes this position is great for people with vulvas to get the friction they really want.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5280898876404><h2>The Kinky Missionary</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hands-behind-ankle.png><p>Maybe one of the first positions you’d think to try when breaking out the restraints, the Kinky Missionary is your standard missionary sex with some added bondage. You’ll want to restrain your partner to a bed (check <a href=#>under-mattress restraint sets</a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow>headboard-friendly cuffs</a> if you’re looking for beginner-friendly gear) and <a href=#>approach missionary</a> as you normally would.&nbsp;</p><p>There are <a href=#>plenty of ways to embrace the power play</a> here, so take some time to talk to one another about what would feel the most exciting (and don’t hesitate to troubleshoot and adjust as you go, especially if its your first time adding this kind of play to your sex life!)&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Queening in Bondage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/on-your-knees.png><p>You may know this position by its other less SFW name — “face sitting” — but Queening in Bondage is when a partner recieves oral stimulation while resting on or above their partner’s mouth. Adding restraint play to this is yet another way to up the sensation and intensity of the scene or sexual encounter, allowing the receiving partner to really own the power of the pose (as pictured here) or offering an equally sexy subversion if you switch places.&nbsp;</p><p>Your weight can mostly held by your knees and thighs, so don’t get too wound up about “crushing” your partner — just make sure they feel comfortable communicating how much pressure is good from you on top!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8607277289837><h2>Standing Room Only</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kinky-missionary.png><p>Standing sex positions can be an incredibly hot way to change things up if you and your partner find yourself in the same old positions time and time again. It feels intuitive for the partner who wants to be cuffed to also be partner recieving — but not a requirement necessarily! Just make sure the partner recieving can adjust their leg; slung around the waist, butt, or thigh is a good place to start, but the un-cuffed partner should help support to get the optimal angle.</p><p>Just check in and make sure restraints aren’t too tight and that you switch things up when and if your cuffed partner gets tired (it happens!). Also: A solid pair of over the door cuffs (<a href=#>these from Unbound are comfy and cute</a>!) will be your best friend here.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4447852760736><h2>Standing Up Full-Frontal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/queening-in-bondage.png><p>Something that almost always seems like a better idea in theory? <a href=#>Shower sex</a>. It’s ideal for early morning quickies and keeping things clean, but depending on the shape of your shower and tub, and whether there’s a possibility of roommates walking in on you (oops), this position can sometimes throw you for a loop. But if you lock your door and schedule some quiet time, it’s definitely do-able.&nbsp;</p><p>One position is ideal if you have a bench or a wider rim of your tub — have the penatrating partner keep both legs on the ground (they do need to keep their balance game together here!) while the partner being penetrated takes them from the front, lifting one leg up to wrap around their partner or to rest on the side of the tub. Just add water.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48768472906404><h2>Soap’n’Grope</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/standing-room-only.png><p><a href=#>Shower sex</a> is meant to be a hands-on activity, clearly — so the Soap’n’Grope variation of a standing position allows the penetrating partner to do a bit more exploring. The partner being penetrated should brace themselves on an available wall as the penetrating partner enters from behind. It’s easily the dirtiest way to have good, clean fun.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.46774193548387><h2>Side Rear-Entry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/standing-full-frontal.png><p>Any <a href=#>pregnant woman will appreciate</a> the Rear-Entry Side Position, a nice relaxing way to have a roll in the hay. It’s also just one of the snuggliest positions around for all kinds of bodies — and excellent for morning sex. Have the penetrating partner enter from behind and snuggle up close with your knees touching, with your hands free to hold one another or play with other erogenous areas along the way.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Queen Takes King</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/soap-and-grope.png><p>For Queen Takes King, you’ll use your favorite chair (or any available surface) and have the receiving partner straddle the penetrating partner’s lap. The receiving partner can situate themselves however it feels comfortable, but feet planted on the ground is a nice way to start. From there, they can rotate, bounce, and grind to their heart’s content.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>A Lazy Grind</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/psxdgkozmqu4d4xlognb.jpeg><p>You don’t need to work hard to feel amazing in bed, and the Lazy Grind is proof.

You’ll lie on your sides, facing each other, with your heads on opposite sides of the bed. The receving partner straddles one of their partner’ and slips one leg up to open up and allow for penetration. The friction and the hot position will keep you both feeling fireworks from start to finish.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqGcmqSknXqiusNmrp6knKOytL%2BOrKOinJWotbDDjm5wanFfqLK5ec%2BoqqKsmaS7tHnTqGStqqlir6ayzqucZrGfqnqltcRo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsex-positions-to-try-before-you-die.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ava-luplow-died-in-a-car-accident-sherwood-death-little-rock-ar-secondary-school-student.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ava-luplow-died-in-a-car-accident-sherwood-death-little-rock-ar-secondary-school-student.html>Ava Luplow Died in a Car Accident Sherwood Death, Little Rock, AR, Secondary School Student,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-dwyane-wade-s-father-dwyane-wade-sr-taking-closer-look-life-heat-legend-s-dad.html>Who is Dwyane Wade's father Dwyane Wade Sr.?
