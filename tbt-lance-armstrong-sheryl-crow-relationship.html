And in many ways it's like having part of your life amputated, but you still have that phantom itch, you know, where you wake up and I'll see something and think, 'Oh, I've got to make sure Lance is hip to this band.

And then I remember, 'Oh, wait, you know, that's not my life.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2008&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with&nbsp;Glamour</a>, Crow (who'd been engaged three times) responded to the journalist's suggestion that she "secretly" didn't want to be married.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are definitely reasons as to why I'm not married," she said.

"Yet, we're up against her biological clock — that pressure is what cracked it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Armstrong admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career in 2013, Crow was asked for her opinion (again and again). Though she often gave canned responses, like she did during an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with&nbsp;USA Today</a>&nbsp;when she said, "The truth will set you free," Crow ultimately let her feelings be known in late 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It probably sounds really insulting, but this is one of those I-don't-give-a-fuck moments: I don't think about him," she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Rolling Stone</a>. "It's a nuisance when I'm asked about him, because they weren't the happiest of days.
