She is a brilliant woman who will have no trouble finding her own way in the world, but that has not stopped the interest in her divorce. People want to know how her life has changed and what she has been up to…</p><h2 id=who-is-t-j-holmes-39-s-ex-wife-marilee-fiebig>Who Is T.J. Holmes's Ex-Wife, Marilee Fiebig?</h2><p>Marilee Fiebig is a well-respected woman who describes herself (at least according to her Instagram bio) as "Chief Diversity Officer for Save The Children, Immigration Lawyer, Fashion & Entmt Exec, Board of Trustees at Brooklyn Independent Middle School, and Mentor at Unlock Her Potential."</p><p>Impressive would be an understatement, and it is not hard to see why people would be drawn to her. She is beautiful and accomplished, and there is much more to her life than her relationship with her now-ex, T.J. Holmes. But sadly, this is why her name has been in the media lately.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Charli D'Amelio, Emily Ratajkowski, And These Celebrities Exposed Their Partner's Cheating Scandals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for her marriage, there was a time when she and T.J. Holmes seemed incredibly happy. In 2014, he wrote a letter for The Root.com (via Us Weekly) detailing how his life had changed in many beautiful ways since she came into his life.</p><p>"My family and I are closer, my individual net worth has gone up every year since we met, I've learned a second language, I'm healthier, I use the N-word less, I listen to Sunday church service more, I'm a better friend, I'm more forgiving than I used to be, I'm more involved in charitable work," he wrote. "In every way, I'm better off because I'm married. So, for me, a successful marriage has revolved around this principle: I like who I am with her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/t-j-holmes-and-amy-robach.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Holmes gushed about his wife again, this time telling the world how grateful he was to have any time with her by his side. In celebration of their 10th anniversary, he made a new post on social media.</p><p>"Asking her for another 10 years would be asking too much. Another 10 months? That may even be a stretch. If she gave me another 10 weeks, I should consider myself lucky. If she puts up with me another 10 days, I'd be grateful," he wrote (via Us Weekly). "But if she would even spare another 10 minutes of her time for me today, I should consider myself blessed. This is MARILEE FIEBIG HOLMES, y'all. And I, T. J. Holmes, do solemnly swear…that I… was HER #decadechallenge."</p><p>As for what went so wrong? We know part of the answer to that, but not all of it...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-marilee-fiebig-and-t-j-holmes>What Happened Between Marilee Fiebig And T.J. Holmes?</h2><p>Before the news of the alleged affair broke, <a href=#>T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach</a> were photographed together looking a little too cozy in November 2022. They had been friends before, but it was believed that something had shifted in their relationship, resulting in it turning romantic when training for the New York City half-marathon.</p><p>Only one month later, it was announced that Holmes and Marilee Fiebig would be divorcing. Sad news for many who believe in true love because the couple had been together for over ten years (they were married in 2010).</p><p>They would not be the only couple to end their relationship, as <a href=#>Robach and her husband, Andrew Shue, would also split</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Addison Rae's Mom Reclaimed Her Life After Her Husband's Scandalous Cheating Rumors?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People Magazine notes that Fiebig and Holmes officially filed for divorce in December 2022, but a source told the publication that they had been separated before this. "This was two consenting adults who were each separated," a source said of the relationship between Holmes and Robach. "They both broke up with their spouses in August within weeks of each other. The relationship didn't start until after that." This is interesting to note because most have disregarded this information and are convinced that something untoward happened and that this was yet <a href=#>another celebrity cheating scandal</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/marilee-fiebig-and-t-j-holmes.jpg><p>In contrast, Page Six claims that Fiebig had been "blindsided" by the news of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holmes' relationship with Robach</a>. "On the air and in person, he would say things like, 'I love love' and 'I just love when people get married' and 'I'm taking the day off 'cause it's my wife's birthday,'" a former co-worker of Holmes revealed to Page Six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At the time, I was like, 'Oh, how sweet.'

Holmes?</h2><p>Marilee Fiebig is an accomplished woman, but she is not a celebrity, so it makes sense that she has kept a low profile since their split. This includes her decision to stay off social media except to post a photo of their daughter, Sabine Holmes, on her 10th birthday. She captioned the post with a heartfelt message about what a blessing her child is and how "the privilege of raising and loving her feels like the gift of my lifetime."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly's Ex Claims He Has A History Of Cheating</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her lawyer did make a statement to Daily Mail giving an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">update on what she has been doing since the split</a>. "During the holiday season and in light of the challenging times, Marilee's sole focus has remained on the overall best interest of her 9-year-old daughter," attorney Stephanie Lehman told the publication. "To that end, T.J.'s lawyer and I have been working together to move their divorce forward privately, expeditiously, and as amicably as possible."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/marilee-fiebig-and-tj-holmes.jpg><p>Lehman continued, "Notwithstanding, we continue to be disappointed by T.J's lack of discretion, respect and sensitivity toward Marilee and the party's daughter. Marilee has been touched by the outpouring of support and looks forward to a new beginning in this new year." But, it sounds like she is doing OK!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyaqaKklZp6p7XEm6CgZZSktq%2BzjKemsGWRm8GmvoytoWagn6G6pr%2BMmp2fmZmneri106FkmqWpYr%2BwrsCcn2afn6SxbrnOq6Wippdirq6x0aKammc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-marilee-fiebig-doing-now-after-tj-holmes-affair-with-amy-robach-good-morning-america.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marlee-matlin-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marlee-matlin-kids.html>Marlee Matlin's Household Is One With &amp;quot;NO Barriers&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./list-of-english-language-pok-c3-a9mon-the-series-sun-26-moon-e2-80-93-ultra-legends-home-video-releases-region-1.html>List of English language Pokmon the Series: Sun &amp;amp; Moon Ultra Legends home video releases (Regi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./list-of-english-language-pok-c3-a9mon-the-series-sun-26-moon-e2-80-93-ultra-legends-home-video-releases-region-1.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
