But like all things, Maury's talk show eventually came to an end, and it seemed like it was time. Maury, who genuinely enjoyed the show because he enjoyed helping people, also walked away with some hefty earnings from the show.</p><p>Yet just because he's retired from Maury doesn't mean the titular host is ready to stop working. He might be worth millions already, but Maury Povich is still making money and staying busy now.</p><h2 id=maury-povich-39-s-controversial-show-ended-in-2022>Maury Povich's Controversial Show Ended In 2022</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/maury-povich-on-his-show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maury's controversial show ran for years, so when it ended, fans were shocked. The <a href=#>show uncovered so many controversies</a> in its heyday, and everyone knew there was no way anyone could replace Maury for the show to go on.</p><p>Maury, for his part, is still living his best (married) life with his wife Connie Chung, and he's surprisingly active on social media. The show has its own TikTok channel, which features entertaining clips plus links to where viewers can watch reruns of the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Maury Povich Think About His Show, "Maury"?</a></span></p><p>Suffice it to say, fans can continue to rewatch all the drama, all these years later, and Maury is probably sitting at home enjoying it the same as he has done for many years. Only now, Maury's sitting at home with his many millions while all of his hard work plays on repeat.</p><h2 id=maury-is-worth-an-impressive-80-million>Maury Is Worth An Impressive $80 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-10.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As controversial as his TV show was, Maury Povich was always a favorite. He was the level-headed host of the show, always providing a voice of reason (and that all-important paternity declaration).</p><p>Povich was handsomely rewarded for his time on the show, <a href=#>building an $80 million net worth</a> over the years. In addition to his earnings from Maury, Povich also picked up a few paychecks by playing himself on various TV shows and in films, plus hosting some other shows (albeit briefly).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Social Media In Mourning As 'Maury' Is Canceled</a></span></p><p>Maury's salary, at least for the last few years of Maury, <a href=#>was around $13 million per year</a>. It doesn't seem as if he and his wife were big spenders, either, though they do own a $8 million mansion in Washington and additional properties in other areas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's sitting on a ton of cash, but the money doesn't seem to be enough to necessarily keep Maury busy in retirement, though. And fans might have mourned the show's ending, but it also seems like Maury himself isn't necessarily ready to let it all go.</p><h2 id=maury-povich-is-making-money-in-a-few-ways-today>Maury Povich Is Making Money In A Few Ways Today</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/maury-povich.jpg><p>Though Maury is probably spending a lot of his time on social media and possibly golfing (he's a pretty good golfer, even in his 80s), he hasn't stopped working either. Case in point? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maury released at-home DNA kits branded The Results Are In</a> in June 2023.</p><p>The at-home DNA tests start at $199, a business model that wasn't originally Maury's idea, though he was totally on board with it. Apparently, the company that provided DNA testing on Maury, DNA Diagnostics Center, came up with a proposal for Maury and his business manager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are no specifics on how much Maury might receive from the project, but given that he's involved in the branding and is the "face" of the test kits, it makes sense if he's paid rather handsomely for being the spokesperson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Maury Povich's Wife Connie Chung And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><p>It's said that Maury's wife Connie Chung is not thrilled about the DNA test product, however. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online called it an "embarrassing cash grab"</a> and suggested that Connie was "livid" over the news of the at-home paternity tests.</p><p>Radar's "source" claimed that Connie only "put up with" Maury's "tacky and trashy" show, so she was happy that the series had ended. Then, the paternity test product emerged, and Connie is reportedly worried that "wackos will come out of the woodwork" when they get paternity results they aren't happy with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, that's all pure speculation, and publicly, Connie—a reporter with her own career and concerns outside her husband's "tacky" show—has been nothing but supportive toward her husband and his ventures.</p><h3 id=does-maury-get-royalties-from-his-show>Does Maury Get Royalties From His Show?</h3><p>As for his earnings from the talk show, it seems like Maury's days of earning millions per year might be over. Since Maury went off the air, the show doesn't appear to be available on the more popular streaming services.</p><h3 id=is-maury-still-airing-old-episodes>Is Maury Still Airing Old Episodes?</h3><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maury Show website does list cities and stations where Maury episodes air</a>, seemingly well into 2023. It's unclear whether those stations will maintain relationships with Maury and continue to air episodes, but given that the show is syndicated, he could be earning money from those deals.</p><p>Hopefully, the fact that the show is so beloved will ensure that it continues to air for ages, earning Maury some retirement income and giving fans their "trashy talk show" fix well into the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyarKuxXaW8t7XCoWSdp5mjtG66zrBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-maury-povich-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./julie-mcadams-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53740-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./julie-mcadams-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53740-html.html>Julie McAdams Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./does-hogwarts-legacy-have-a-photo-mode.html>Does Hogwarts Legacy have a photo mode?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./does-hogwarts-legacy-have-a-photo-mode.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
