And there's more: Along with his brother Vitali, Wladimir has been included in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Records as the champion who won the most boxing heavyweight world title fights</a> in history.</p><p>Recently, the charismatic ex-boxer has been back in the limelight with pleas for assistance for his homeland, Ukraine, as it faces invasion by Russia.</p><h2 id=the-boxer-with-a-phd>The Boxer With A PhD</h2><p>Wladimir is one of <a href=#>a handful of celebrities who has a Ph.D.</a> He often lectures in Sports science at the University of St Gallen, Switzerland.

Since 2009, the entertainment world has been fascinated by the tempestuous love story between the 6 foot 6 boxing champion and a diminutive Hollywood star. <a href=#>Hayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko's relationship</a> has held the fans' interest for the last thirteen years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The glamorous couple met at a book launch more than a decade ago, and they dated for two years before breaking up.

In the meantime, the Heroes star and the world champion had a child together.

It's a small wonder that fans would like more details about his private life.</p><p>Yet there’s no listing of the mysterious Aleksandra on Wikipedia’s 'Personal life' section about the famous ex-boxer. According to News Unzip, it would seem Wladimir's ex-wife is also a celebrity in their homeland of Ukraine.</p><p>Apparently famous as an actress and model, the site says she was married to Wladimir for two years between 1996 and 1998. The site also mentions that after the couple divorced, the enigmatic beauty reverted to her maiden surname and is now known as Aleksandra Avizova. Similarly, there's no information on her under that name, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further data on the site include mention of her birthday, 16th May 1975. Apparently Aleksandra has featured in commercials for a number of famous fashion brands and has appeared on TV shows and in films. Even her net worth is mentioned, estimated to be around $3 Million.</p><h2 id=little-kaya-may-have-a-brother>Little Kaya May Have A Brother</h2><p>Some other details on the site reveal that Aleksandra has a son, Michael Avizova.

However, Hayden Panettiere certainly has. On 6 December 2013, while she was still engaged to Wladimir, the pair addressed the crowds at the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Nashville star also recently posted a lengthy caption on Instagram expressing her unwavering support for the country and joining other stars who are helping to raise funds for those affected by the conflict.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Mila Kunis Raise To Help Ukraine?</a></span></p><p>But whether Aleksandra even exists or not remains a mystery for now.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Amy Schumer Slammed For Insensitive Ukraine Joke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw8uam6Klmad6rLjIraqcoJukwG6x12auop6VYq6tscqsmKecopZ8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-wladimir-klitschkos-ex-wife-aleksandra.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paid-off-car-better-than-new.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paid-off-car-better-than-new.html>Woman Urges Folks with Paid off Vehicles to Keep It That Way, Avoid the &amp;quot;Trap&amp;quot; of New Car Payments</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-are-christopher-walkens-parents-christopher-walken-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more.html>Who are Christopher Walkens Parents?
