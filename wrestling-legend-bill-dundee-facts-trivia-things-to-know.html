One of the more notable of his career was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working for Mid-South Wrestling</a>, the result of MSW business being down while Memphis was on a hot streak.

On top of horning in on everyone’s territories, ICW would also <a href=#>antagonize their rival promotions</a> in various ways, creating a tense situation and leading to an altercation between Randy Savage and Bill Dundee in the parking lot of a Tennessee gym in 1982.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Wrestlers That Macho Man Randy Savage Had Beef With (& 5 That He Loved)</a></span></p><p>Details on the incident vary, but basically an outnumbered Dundee pulled a gun and Savage struck Dundee, breaking his face.
