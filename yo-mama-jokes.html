<time>26 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Before we begin, we want to make it perfectly clear that we have nothing against your mother. We've never met the woman, but she sounds like an upstanding person and a nurturing, wonderful parent. All of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>jokes</a> you're about to read are most definitely not about your beloved mom, who is beyond reproach and the best human being who ever existed. To be honest, we're not even sure why we're publishing all of these yo mama jokes. If you ask us, they're kind of old, cheap, and overused.</p><p>Just like yo mama!</p><p>Sorry, sorry, that was too easy. But that's what happens when the topic of yo mama jokes comes up. You feel strangely compelled to say things that no mature adult would ever say out loud about another person's mother. What kind of monster would do such a thing?</p><p>Well, according to a 2017 study from the Medical University of Vienna, making these jokes might mean <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Cognitive and emotional demands of black humour processing: the role of intelligence, aggressiveness and mood" href=# data-citation=true>that you're intelligent</a>. That's right, enjoying humor that's dark, offensive, and really, really rude—like every yo mama joke ever written—could indicate a higher-than-usual IQ. That is, as long as it's clearly meant as a joke, and you never try to make a convincing case to a pal about why his mama is so ugly. There's a big difference between being funny and being a jerk.</p><p>Read on for 169 funny yo mama jokes, sorted by every category you could possibly think of. Share them at your own risk. And if yo mama asks, no, we weren't talking about her.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>95 Dirty Jokes So Racy, You'll Want to Cover Your
